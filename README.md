## Projects

**Spatial Analysis on COVID-19** ([Live App](https://covid-19-data-visualizer.streamlit.app/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/covid-19-analysis))  
An interactive web application built with Streamlit that visualizes global and country-specific COVID-19 data. The app displays confirmed cases and deaths worldwide, along with an interactive map showing deaths by country with adjustable thresholds. It features time-series line charts for confirmed cases and deaths by selected country, a pie chart to illustrate fatality ratio, and resampled bar charts for daily, monthly, and yearly trends. A searchable country list provides quick access to key metrics.

 **Airline Ticket Price Prediction** ([Live App](https://airline-ticket-price.streamlit.app/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/airline-ticket-prediction))  
A real-time airline ticket price prediction web app developed using FastAPI and scikit-learn. The app features a clean HTML form built with Jinja2 templates for user input and predicts flight prices based on various parameters using a trained Random Forest model. The project follows a well-organized structure and supports Docker for containerized deployment. It also uses a `.env` file for managing environment-based configurations.

**IDR Currency Classifier** ([Live App](https://idr-currency-classification.streamlit.app/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/idr-currency-classification))  
A machine learning web app built with Streamlit and TensorFlow to classify Indonesian Rupiah banknotes from uploaded images. The app utilizes a pretrained MobileNetV2-based model to recognize currency denominations and displays the top prediction with a confidence score. It also includes an expandable section showing the top five class probabilities. The application is configured using environment variables through a `.env` file for flexible model path management and uses caching to efficiently load the model and optimize performance.
